How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Much more efficient to use version control to compare two different files of code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Nice handy organized way of having all versions of changes that you could revert back to.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    PROS: Control when it commits with each logical step
		  Ensures each commit is made with full code
	CONS: Adds in human error

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To keep a logical order of changes together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log shows you the list/order of commits and git diff is used to compare the commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Easier to see how to revert back to; before changes were made.
	Nice and easy to compare code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Learning how to code??
